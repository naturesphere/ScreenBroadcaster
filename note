screen split protocol:

[8 bytes time stamp]    + 
[1 bytes packet amount] +
[1 bytes packet index]  +
[data...]


for long to byte array
[01...7] => bytes [7]...[1][0]


problem meeted:
1: n |= (((long)(0xff&buf[i]))<<8*i); 
the long must inside

2:Arrays.copyOfRange(Data, from, to);
the from to area is [from,to)!

3:receiver.receive(packet);after receive, 
the data is in buf,and length is packet.getLength()
